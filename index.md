**Staff-Level Software and Data Engineer**  
Greater Madison Area, WI · Open to Remote

I’m a staff-level data engineer who designs and builds **end-to-end data platforms and data-backed products** — spanning ingestion, modeling, APIs, and analytics — with a focus on systems teams can trust, understand, and extend over time.

I’ve spent much of my career working in large, distributed engineering organizations, serving as both **technical and project lead** for initiatives involving engineers across the U.S., Europe, India, and China. I’m comfortable operating in remote and hybrid environments, and I tend to be most effective in complex efforts where clarity, alignment, and good engineering judgment matter more than formal authority.

## How I lead

My leadership shows up through **architecture, execution, and alignment**, rather than people management.

I’m often asked to help when goals are ambiguous, systems are under strain, or multiple teams need to converge around shared data and platforms. In those situations, I focus on making tradeoffs explicit, establishing clear ownership, and helping teams move forward with confidence.

In practice, that includes:

- Acting as **technical owner** for shared data platforms and services  
- Setting direction for systems that span teams, organizations, and time zones  
- Translating unclear goals into concrete designs, milestones, and delivery plans  
- Aligning stakeholders with competing incentives around shared data contracts  
- Mentoring engineers to reason about systems, tradeoffs, and long-term impact

## What I build

I enjoy working on systems that sit at the foundation of other teams’ work.

- **Data platforms** that support analytics, APIs, and ML without duplication  
- **Durable data models and pipelines** designed to evolve without breaking consumers  
- **Backend services and APIs** built on top of data systems  
- **Experiment-ready datasets** that enable analytics and ML teams  
- **Trust mechanisms** such as data quality checks, observability, lineage, and clear ownership

## Selected projects

### OpenVelo Insight — AI-assisted cycling conditions platform

A personal project exploring how AI can be layered on top of well-structured data systems to deliver actionable, explainable insights. The system ingests weather and air-quality data, models conditions across time windows, and uses an AI agent to generate contextual recommendations.

- End-to-end data ingestion and modeling  
- Analytics and scoring logic surfaced via an AI interface  
- Emphasis on explainability and user-facing insight over opaque predictions

### Event-Driven Open Weather Insight

An event-driven data platform prototype built to explore ingestion, processing, and storage patterns for open weather data. The focus is on reliability, scalability, and observability in modern data pipelines.

- Event-driven and asynchronous processing  
- Emphasis on durable pipelines and clear data ownership  
- Platform-oriented design over ad-hoc analytics
