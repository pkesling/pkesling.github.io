**Staff-Level Data Engineer**  
Greater Madison Area, WI · Open to Remote

I’m a staff-level data engineer who leads the design and delivery of **end-to-end data platforms and data-backed products** — spanning ingestion, modeling, APIs, and analytics — with a focus on systems that teams can trust and extend.

I’ve served as **technical and project lead** for high-impact initiatives involving engineers across the U.S., Europe, India, and China, aligning teams with different incentives around shared data platforms. Much of my career has been spent working in remote and hybrid environments, guiding complex efforts through influence, clarity, and ownership rather than formal authority.

## How I lead

My leadership shows up through **architecture, execution, and alignment**, not people management.

- Acting as **technical owner** for cross-team data platforms and services
- Setting direction for systems that span multiple organizations and time zones
- Translating ambiguous goals into concrete designs, milestones, and delivery plans
- Aligning stakeholders with competing priorities around shared data contracts
- Mentoring engineers to reason about systems, tradeoffs, and long-term impact

## What I build

- **Data platforms** that support analytics, APIs, and ML without duplication
- **Durable data models and pipelines** designed to survive change
- **Backend services and APIs** built on top of data systems
- **Experiment-ready datasets** that enable analytics and ML teams
- **Trust mechanisms**: data quality checks, observability, lineage, and clear ownership

## Selected projects

### OpenVelo Insight — AI-assisted cycling conditions platform
A personal project exploring how AI can be layered on top of well-structured data systems to deliver actionable insights. The system ingests weather and air-quality data, models conditions across time windows, and uses an AI agent to generate contextual recommendations.

- End-to-end data ingestion and modeling
- Analytics and scoring logic surfaced via an AI interface
- Focus on explainability and user-facing insight rather than opaque predictions

### Event-Driven Open Weather Insight
An event-driven data platform prototype that ingests and processes weather data using decoupled services. Designed to explore reliability, scalability, and observability concerns in modern data pipelines.

- Event-driven and asynchronous processing
- Emphasis on durable pipelines and clear data ownership
- Platform-oriented design over ad-hoc analytics
